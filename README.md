# FAQ
### Q1: Who is on the development team?
The founder/creator of BradCraft is 5tayer. The developers on the team is currently only Tater (hopefully soon to change). Contributors to the pack are Brad, Pr1vat3 Ryan, and Agent Owl/Bender.

### Q2: When will version 1.2 release? It's been forever!
We don't know. Coming up with new ideas is tricky. However, we do feel as if the release date is approaching. We'll let you all know when it's ready.

### Q3: Will you support Bedrock Edition?
We would love to! And it is in our best interest to. Unfortunately, Bedrock resource packs work completely different than Java, which would make the process of converting the pack to work with it tough, and would probably take a while to do. Because of this, **we've made the difficult decision to stay only on Java for now.** However, if you are experienced with Bedrock resource packs, and are interested in helping us support Bedrock Edition, please DM 5tayer.

### Q4: Can I contribute to the pack/join the development team?
That depends on a few things. For simple contributions, let 5tayer know about your creation. If we deem it epic enough, we will absolutely add it (with proper credit)! Regarding joining the development team, likely no. Sorry! We do plan on opening submissions soon, however.

### Q5: Can I be in the pack?
**No.**

### Q6: Will BradCraft ever become a mod?
Similar to Q3, we would love for this to happen! BradCraft as a mod would allow for the vanilla items/mobs to coexist in the game. Again, creating a mod is an *incredibly* tricky process. Therefore, for the time being we're gonna keep the project as a resource pack. However, if you are interested in helping us turn it into a mod, please DM 5tayer.

*(and no, we wouldn't use MCreator. it's not flexible enough for our needs)*
