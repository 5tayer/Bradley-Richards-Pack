Version 1.3 ALPHA 3
Released February 11, 2023
# NEW
### v1.3 Custom GUI
You will likely notice a significant change immediately when you switch this version on in-game. v1.3 Alpha 3 introduces the beginning stages of an upcoming feature for the full release of v1.3, a custom GUI look and feel. As this is in Alpha, many aspects have either not been updated, or look unfinished. Tweaks will be made by the full release. Also, please let me know about any possible criticism or feedback you have on the GUI. If some parts are considered to be too "non-vanilla", I can always make that into a separate add-on.

As for everything already here:
- The in-game GUI now uses a dark theme
	- Dark mode assets were created by the (epic) team at Vanilla Tweaks: https://vanillatweaks.net/
- Parts of the GUI turn blue when hovered over
### Other Additions
- The Impostor has a new "primed" sound
	- Note: Sometimes the normal fuse sound will play, this is just how Minecraft works
- A new damage sound has been added, possible by using the ability of adding new sounds in resource packs

# CHANGED
- All in-game sounds have been converted to mono (similar to v1.2.2)
- Updated the end credits to match the current-era of the pack

# REMOVED
- Removed the original custom sound for the fuse
